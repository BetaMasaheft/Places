                     developed as a major centre only after

                  <ab type="history">The town of Gondar is located in today's <placeName ref="LOC6544NorthGondar">North Gondar</placeName> Zone (historically
                        <placeName ref="LOC1713Bagemd">Bagemdǝr</placeName> province) in the
                        <placeName ref="LOC1426Amhara">ʾAmhārā</placeName> Regional State. Gondar
                     started to flourish after

                        <date>1630s</date> to <date>1760s</date>), Gondar was the political,
                     religious, cultural and intellectual capital of the <placeName ref="LOC6554GondarineK">Gondarine Kingdom</placeName>. Its founder <persName ref="PRS4015Fasilada">Fāsiladas</persName> built the first nucleus of the
                     town including his castle, some churches and his pleasure pool. After him, his
                     son 
                     <persName ref="PRS10375Yohanne"><roleName type="title">ʾaṣe</roleName> Yoḥānnǝs I</persName> and grandson 
                     <persName ref="PRS5616IyasuI"><roleName type="title">ʾaṣe</roleName> ʾIyāsu I</persName> chose to remain in Gondar and
                     built their own castles and churches. So by the late <date>17th century</date>,
                     Gondar had become a permanent and sizeable settlement where Ethiopian rulers
                     resided when not campaigning and where the highest commercial, political and
                     religious classes gathered around the throne. In the <date>17th century</date>
                     Gondar also became the major commercial centre of northern <placeName ref="LOC3010Ethiop">Ethiopia</placeName>. During the <date>18th
                        century</date>, the royal compound was completed with the construction of
                     castles by <persName ref="PRS3430DawitII">Dāwit III</persName>, <persName ref="PRS2377Bakaffa">Bakāffā</persName> and <persName ref="PRS5617IyasuII">ʾIyāsu II</persName>, the church of <placeName ref="LOC1582ASSaSa">ʾAṭṭāṭāmi
                        Mikāʾel</placeName> by <persName ref="PRS3430DawitII">Dāwit III</persName>
                     and various subsidiary buildings (the whole surrounded by a double wall with
                     twelve gates and reinforcing towers). However, by the late <date>18th
                        century</date>, no more castles were built and, from the <date>19th
                        century</date>, Gondar gradually lost its political power and shrank in size
                     while the centre of the power moved to <placeName ref="LOC5597Sawa">Šawā</placeName>. <persName ref="PRS9430Tewodros">Tewodros II</persName>
                     set his capital in <placeName ref="LOC2385DabraT">Dabra Tābor</placeName> and,
                     in <date>1866</date> attacked, burnt and looted Gondar. Finally, in
                        <date>1888</date> and <date>1889</date>, the Mahdists attacked and burnt
                     down what was left of the city which saw some redevelopment only in the
                        <date>1920s</date> . During the Italian occupation, Gondar became the
                     capital of the <placeName ref="LOC6552Amhara">Governo dell'Amhara</placeName>
                     (one of six governorates forming the <placeName ref="LOC6553Africa">Africa
                        Orientale Italiana</placeName>), it was restructured and rebuilt along
                     modernist lines and its population increased significantly. After the defeat of
                     the Italians in <date>1941</date>, Gondar became the capital of the Province of
                        <placeName ref="LOC1713Bagemd">Bagemdǝr</placeName> and <placeName ref="LOC5671Semen">Sǝmen</placeName>, flourished and grew in population
                     becoming a major commercial and cultural centre.</ab>
                  <ab type="description">Gondar has enjoyed a strategic position: it is 35 km north
                     of the lake <placeName ref="LOC5888Tana"> Ṭānā</placeName> close to the point
                     where two strategic caravan routes joined. It also benefited from being
                     surrounded by a semicircle of mountains and close to fertile lands and water
                     supply. Historically, Gondar population was divided into two main groups that
                     lived in clearly separated quarters and neighbourhoods: the royal court and
                     nobility on the one hand; the merchants, craftsmen and commoners on the other.
                     Until the Italian occupation, Muslims and <persName ref="ETH1274Betaes">Beta
                        ʾƎsrāʾel</persName> had to live separated from the Christians and were
                     assigned precise quarters. Gondar is today one of the largest cities in
