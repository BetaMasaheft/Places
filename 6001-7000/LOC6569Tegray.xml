                    <note>
                        <ab type="history">The origins of Tǝgrāy and its population are ancient and
                            complex, with Cushit, Semitic, south Arabian and Sabaic elements and
                            interactions. Pre-Aksumite inscriptions show that the area of historical
                            Tǝgrāy was marked by a Sabaic-influenced kingdom, which had merged with
                            a local culture. In later Aksumite times migration again linked both
                            sides of the Red Sea, with Aksumite settlements also on the Arabian
                            side. A variant of the term Tǝgrāy first appears in a <date
                                notBefore="0900" notAfter="0999">10th-century</date> gloss to
                                <persName ref="PRS3204CosmasI">Cosmas Indicopleustes</persName>,
                            although its origin and meaning are unclear. Probalby three main phases
                            in the development of the toponym "Tǝgrāy" (toponym probably of ethnic
                            origin) can be identified. 1) HISTORICAL TƎGRĀY: Historical Tǝgrāy was
                            the most important northern province of <placeName ref="LOC3010Ethiop"
                                >Ethiopia</placeName> due to its symbolic, economic and strategic
                            power. It encompassed <placeName ref="LOC1264Adwa">ʿAdwā</placeName>,
                                <placeName ref="LOC1310Aksum">ʾAksum</placeName> and <placeName
                                ref="LOC6384Yeha">Yǝḥa</placeName>, but it also extended and
                            controlled adiacent territories, periodically including other areas
                            beyond its central core. Territories that were often and for long
                            periods of time subject to Tǝgrāy's control include <placeName
                                ref="LOC3826Hawzen">Ḥawzen</placeName> and <placeName
                                ref="LOC2973Enticc">Ǝnṭiḉḉo</placeName> and sometimes also
                                <placeName ref="LOC5749Sire">Šire</placeName> and <placeName
                                ref="LOC5882Tamben">Tamben</placeName>. Tǝgrāy was densely populated
                            since ancient times and the source of migration movements towards
                            other areas. The capital of historical Tǝgrāy changed over time:
                                <placeName ref="LOC3826Hawzen">Ḥawzen</placeName> was capital for
                            periods of time in both the <date notBefore="1600" notAfter="1699"
                                >17th</date> and the <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1899">19th
                                century</date>; <placeName ref="LOC1264Adwa">ʿAdwā</placeName>
                            became capital in the <date notBefore="1700" notAfter="1799">18th
                                century</date> and competed for this role with <placeName
                                ref="LOC4545Maqala">Maqala</placeName> in the last decades of this
                            century. Tǝgrāy owed part of its importantce to the sacred town of
                                <placeName ref="LOC1310Aksum">ʾAksum</placeName> that was part of
                            its territory, althugh enjoyed its own self-government. During the
                            Zamana masāfǝnt, Tǝgrāy was one of the most important self-governed
                            provinces. 2) TƎGRĀY PROVINCE: <persName ref="PRS10378Yohanne">Yoḥannǝs
                                IV</persName> (<date when="1871">1871</date>-<date when="1889"
                                >1889</date>) and his successors unified historical Tǝgrāy and other
                            northen territories, so that in the 20th century, historical Tǝgrāy
                            became a province of its own within a larger administrative province
                            also called Tǝgrāy/Tǝgre. After <persName ref="PRS10378Yohanne">Yoḥannǝs
                                IV</persName>, Tǝgrāy lost importance and was subject to outside
                            pressure and challenges. Much of Tǝgrāy was briefly occupied by the
                            Italians in the foremath of the <date when="1896">1896</date> Battle of
                                <placeName ref="LOC1264Adwa">ʿAdwā</placeName> and it was one of the
                            major battle grounds during the Italian War (<date when="1935"
                                >1935</date>–<date when="1936">1936</date>). During the Italian
                            occupation, Tǝgrāy was incorporated into the Eritrean Colony and after
                                <date when="1941">1941</date> was again reunited with <placeName
                                ref="LOC3010Ethiop">Ethiopia</placeName>, although it was
                            increasingly marginalized and victim of centralization, political
                            suppression, forced resettlement and famines. In 1946, Tǝgre became one
                            of 12 ṭaqlāy gǝzāts with capital <placeName ref="LOC4545Maqala"
                                >Maqala</placeName> and the governors of this province maintained
                            strong political ties with their provinces also in the late 1960s. After
                            the Revolution of 1974, Tǝgre changed name to Tǝgrāy and
                            administratively became a kǝfla hāgar. With the promulgation of the 1987
                            Constitution, Tǝgrāy became one of five "autonomous regions" (yarās gaz
                            ʾakkābābi) Tǝgrāy was the cradle of resistance movements that took power
                            in <date when="1991">1991</date>. 3) TƎGRĀY KƎLLƎL: Tǝgrāy went through
                            several administrative changes through its history, until in <date
                                when="1991">1991</date> it changed its administrative status
                            becoming one of <placeName ref="LOC3010Ethiop">Ethiopia</placeName>'s
                            kǝllǝl and came to incorporate territories that had previously not been
                            part of the historical province (as well as losing others). See
