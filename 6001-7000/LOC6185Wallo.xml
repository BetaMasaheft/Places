                  <ab type="history">Wallo is an area in central <placeName ref="LOC3010Ethiop">Ethiopia</placeName> and takes its name from a large <persName ref="ETH1973Oromo">Oromo</persName>'s subgroup that settled in this area
                     from the <date notBefore="1550" notAfter="1600">late 16th cent.</date>. The
                        <persName ref="ETH1973Oromo">Oromo</persName> of Wallo were further divided
                     into seven main sub-units that lived in different parts of Wallo and have been
                     used until today to designate the major administrative divisions of this area.
                     In spite of being occupied by <persName ref="ETH1973Oromo">Oromo</persName>,
                     certain parts of Wallo were deeply influenced by the <persName ref="ETH1126Amhara">ʾAmhārā</persName> language and culture and were
                     involved in the Christian monarchy politics, especially during the <date notBefore="1700" notAfter="1799">18th</date> and <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1899">19th century</date>. Other parts of Wallo retained a
                     separate identity and adhered to Islam, undertaking a process of islamisation
                     of Wallo in the <date notBefore="1700" notAfter="1799">18th century</date>.
                     However, from the <date notBefore="1850" notAfter="1899">mid-19th
                        century</date>, the Christian Emperors undertook the re-conquest and
                     Christian conversion of Wallo in name of a political reunification as well as
                     to preserve the hegemony of the Christian faith and state. In spite of this,
                     Islam has survived in Wallo where there are important centres of Islamic
                     learning and shrines. In <date when="1917">1917</date>, with the defeat of
                        <roleName type="title">rās</roleName>
                     <persName ref="PRS7079Mikael">Mikāʾel</persName> , father of <persName ref="PRS5620IyasuV">ʾIyāsu</persName>, Wallo lost its importance and was
                     reduced to a buffer zone to be ruled and taxed for the benefit of Šawān
                     officials. Following these events, the imperial power monitored Wallo carefully
                     an <persName ref="PRS5226haylase">Ḫāyla Śǝllāse I</persName> regarded it as a
                     potentially insurrectionary area and kept it subjugated with a strong military
                     presence. Following the Italian defeat in <date when="1941">1941</date>, Wallo
                     continued to be looked at with suspicion, was neglected by the central power in
                     the process of modernization and governed by non-local governors. Some of its
                     territories were merged with <placeName ref="LOC5597Sawa">Šawā</placeName> and
                        <placeName ref="LOC6569Tegray">Tǝgrāy</placeName>. Wallo played a role in
                     the end of the regime of <persName ref="PRS5226haylase">Ḫāyla Śǝllāse
                        I</persName>: in <date when="1973">1973</date>, it was hit by a dramatic
                     famine which caused scandal and triggered protests that culminated in the
                     Ethiopian Revolution of <date when="1974">1974</date>. Following another severe
                     famine in <date when="1984">1984</date> and the Darg's policy of forced
                     resettlement, the anti-regime movement operating in Wallo received great
                     support and played an important role in the collapse of the regime in <date when="1991">1991</date>.</ab>
                  <ab type="description">Wallo is one of the major areas of central Ethiopia and
