                            divided into three phases: foundation (from <date>1630s</date> to
                                <date>1706</date>), transition and insecurity (<date>1706</date> to

                                <date>1704</date> showed how much the territories of the kingdom had
                            reduced to include only the lands within and north of the great bend of
                            the <placeName ref="LOC1022Abbay">Blue Nile</placeName> due to <persName
                                ref="ETH1973Oromo">Oromo</persName>'s expansion. Increasing internal
                            and theological conflicts within the Ethiopian Orthodox Church
                            negatively affected the royal court as it became apparent after the
                            assassination of <persName ref="PRS5616IyasuI">ʾIyāsu I</persName> in
                                <date>1706</date>. <persName ref="PRS5616IyasuI">ʾIyāsu
                            I</persName>'s death opened a phase of instability for the kingdom which
                            came to an end in the <date>1720s</date>, mainly thanks to the role of
                                <persName ref="PRS2377Bakaffa">Bakāffā</persName>'s consort
                                <persName ref="PRS2682BerhanM">Mǝntǝwwāb</persName>. From the
                                <date>1760s</date>, the court gradually lost control due to the
                            death of some key supporters of <persName ref="PRS2682BerhanM"
                                >Mǝntǝwwāb</persName>, her ageing and the increasing power of
                            regional nobles. During the <date>17th century</date>, the Gondarine
                            Kingdom pursued relationships with Yemen, Turkey and India while they
                            turned away from the West except for commercial relationships with the
                            Dutch. In the <date>18th century</date>, some rulers considered
                            entertaining new relationships with Europe but faced opposition by
                            popular opinion.</ab>

                            in the 1630s with its capital in Gondar and which lasted until the
                            1760s. The construction of palaces and churches by the kingdom's founder
