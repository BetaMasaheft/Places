                  <ab type="history">The church of ʾAksum Ṣǝyon has a long and complex history of
                     destructions and reconstructions with a number of legendary aspects. It has a
                     key role in Ethiopia's cultural heritage and is referred to in a number of
                     sources: <ref type="work" corresp="LIT1913Mashaf">Maṣḥāfa ʾAksum</ref>,
                        <persName ref="PRS1778Alvares">Francisco Alvares</persName>'s account (ca.
                        <date when="1520" precision="low">1520</date>), <ref type="work" corresp="LIT1473GadlaL">Gadla Libānos</ref> (<date when="1400" precision="low">1400</date>), Iter de Venetiis ad Indiam (<date when="1400" precision="low">1400</date>), etc. Although the remains of ancient
                     structures were identified under or embedded in today's church, the early
                     history of this church is hard to reconstruct and involved legendary figures
                     such as <persName ref="PRS1284Abrehaa">ʾAbrǝhā and ʾAṣbǝḥā</persName> and
                        <roleName type="title">queen</roleName>

                     <persName ref="PRS3429DawitII">Dāwit II</persName> ordered the church restored
                     in <date when="1406">1406</date>. The possessions of the church grew significantly over
                     time and <ref type="work" corresp="LIT1913Mashaf">Maṣḥāfa ʾAksum</ref> records
                     a number of land grants to the church. ʾAksum Ṣǝyon was destroyed in <date when="1535">1535</date> by <persName ref="PRS1522Ahmadb">Aḥmad b. Ibrāhīm
                        al-Ġāzī</persName> and then rebuilt by <roleName type="title">ʾaṣe</roleName>
                     <persName ref="PRS8550sardaDe">Śarṣa Dǝngǝl</persName> in the <date from="1550" to="1600">second half of the 16th cent</date>. According to a Jesuit annual
                     letter, it was burned down by the <persName ref="ETH1973Oromo">Oromo</persName>
                     in <date when="1611">1611</date> but it was probably quickly restored as the
                     church was visited and described by <persName ref="PRS1767Almeida">Manoel de
                        Almeida</persName>, <persName ref="PRS2462Barreto">Tomás Barreto</persName>
                     and <persName ref="PRS2477Barradas">Manoel Barradas</persName> in the <date from="1620" precision="low" to="1635">1620s - early 1630s</date>. The church
                     was restored in <date when="1655">1655</date> by <roleName type="title">ʾaṣe</roleName>
                     <persName ref="PRS4015Fasilada">Fāsiladas</persName> and again in<date from="1749" to="1750">
                        1749-50</date> by <roleName type="title">ʾaṣe</roleName>
                     <persName ref="PRS5617IyasuII">ʾIyāsu II</persName>. Following this last restoration the church has
                     remained the same, except for some <date from="1801" to="2000" precision="low">19th-20th cent.</date> alterations, while the surrounding buildings have
                     experienced radical changes including the new round church of <placeName ref="LOC6564MaryamS">Māryām Ṣǝyon</placeName> built by
                        <roleName type="title">ʾaṣe</roleName>
                     <persName ref="PRS5226haylase">Ḫāyla Śǝllāse I</persName> next to the old one. </ab>
                  <ab type="description">The <ref type="work" corresp="LIT1913Mashaf">Maṣḥāfa
                        ʾAksum</ref> describes ʾAksum Ṣǝyon in technical terms while <persName ref="PRS1778Alvares">Francisco Alvares</persName> describes the old church
                     as "<quote>very large; it has five aisles of good width and great length,
                        vaulted above, and all the vaults closed, the ceiling and sides all painted.
                        Below, the body of the church is well worked with handsome cut stone; it has
                        seven chapels, all with their backs to the east, and their altars well
                        ornamented. It has a choir after our fashion, except that it is low, and
                        they reach the vaulted roof with their heads; and the choir is also over the
                        vault, and they do not use it.</quote>" Following the church reconstruction
                     by <persName ref="PRS8550sardaDe">Śarṣa Dǝngǝl</persName>, it is described by the sources as
                     presenting a new smaller church built into the remains and walls of a larger older
                     church. The local tradition maintains that the Ark of the Covenant is in the
                     church of ʾAksum Ṣǝyon.</ab>
