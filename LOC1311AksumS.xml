                  <ab type="history">The church of ʾAksum Ṣǝyon has a long and complex history of
                     destructions and reconstructions with a number of legendary aspects. It has a
                     key role in Ethiopia's cultural heritage and is referred to in a number of
                     sources: <ref type="work" corresp="LIT1913Mashaf">Maṣḥāfa ʾAksum</ref>,
                        <persName ref="PRS1778Alvares">Francisco Alvares</persName>'s account (1520
                     ca.), <ref type="work" corresp="LIT1473GadlaL">Gadla Libānos</ref> (1400), Iter
                     de Venetiis ad Indiam (1400). Although the remains of ancient structures were
                     identified under or embedded in today's church, the early history of this
                     church is hard to reconstruct and involved legendary figures such as <persName
                        ref="PRS1284Abrehaa">ʾAbrǝhā and ʾAṣbǝḥā</persName> and <roleName

                     <persName ref="PRS3429DawitII">Dāwit II</persName> ordered the church restored
                     in <date>1406</date>. The possessions of the church grew significantly over
                     time and <ref type="work" corresp="LIT1913Mashaf">Maṣḥāfa ʾAksum</ref> records
                     a number of land grants to the church. The church was destroyed in
                        <date>1535</date> by <persName ref="PRS1522Ahmadb">Aḥmad b. Ibrāhīm

                     <persName ref="PRS8550sardaDe">Śarṣa Dǝngǝl</persName> in the second half of
                     the <date>16th cent.</date>. According to a Jesuit annual letter, it was burned
                     down by the <persName ref="ETH1973Oromo">Oromo</persName> in <date>1611</date>
                     but it was probably quickly restored as the church was visited and described by
                     Manoel de Almeida, Thomas Barreto and Emmanuel Barradas in the 1620s - early
                     1630s. The church was restored in 1655 by ʾaṣe Fāsiladas and again in 1749-50 by ʾaṣe ʾ</ab>

                        ʾAksum</ref> describes ʾAksum Ṣǝyon in technical terms, <persName
                        ref="PRS1778Alvares">Francisco Alvares</persName> describes the old church
                     as "very large; it has five aisles of good width and great length, vaulted
                     above, and all the vaults closed, the ceiling and sides all painted. Below, the
                     body of the church is well worked with handsome cut stone; it has seven
                     chapels, all with their backs to the east, and their altars well ornamented. It
                     has a choir after our fashion, except that it is low, and they reach the
                     vaulted roof with their heads; and the choir is also over the vault, and they
                     do not use it." </ab> Following the church reconstruction by <persName
                     ref="PRS8550sardaDe">Śarṣa Dǝngǝl</persName>, it is described as having a new
                  smaller church built into the remains and walls of a larger older church. </note>
